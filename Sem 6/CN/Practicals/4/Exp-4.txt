	Experiment - 4

Aim : Design a Topology of P2P (Point to Point) of two node and CSMA(Carries Sense Multiple Access) Channel (4 Nodes) Specifying Bandwidth 5mpbs and 100 mbps Respectively. Study IP Address assignment mechanism and p-cap file generation process. 

Note: This a multipoint system, this is like BUS. CSMA is the technical logic behind it.

P2P - Dedicated Connection b/w 2 nodes only
CSMA - BUS Multipoint 

4 Nodes to a common channel 

Role of n1 is gateway node because it is connecting two networks and it is acting as a interface 

CSMA is a MAC(Media Access Control) protocol 

CSMA is one channel shared by all nodes to conmected to it
